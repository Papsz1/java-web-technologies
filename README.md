# java-web-technologies

A java web application for a catering and food delivery system, that I created to improve my knowledge of different technologies, such as:
- Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, JDBC, Gradle, Apache Tomcat

More specifically:
- Includes a REST API built with a Spring controller
- DAO using Spring Data JPA
- DAO also using JDBC
- DAO with a simple memory based solution, where data is stored in a map
- MySQL for the database
- Gradle as the build tool
- Apache Tomcat
- A Jakarta servlet based web frontend which uses the war plugin  
- And other stuff such as lombok
